		<p> Hey! My name is Nicholas Moorhead and this is my website. I'm a student at the Start Up Institute, class of summer 2014. I also work as a journalist at Somerville News. This website is a work in progress and I know the layout resembles a bad project made for an 8th grade computer science class. Please bear with me! </p>
